# HTTP/HTTPS Listen Ports

By default API Umbrella will startup and listen on the default HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 and 443). If you'd like to run API Umbrella on different ports, you can make changes to the `/etc/api-umbrella/api-umbrella.yml` config file:

```yaml
http_port: 8080
https_port: 8443
```
