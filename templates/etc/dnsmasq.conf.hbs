# We normally like logging via stdout and dnsmasq does support this via the "-"
# value. However, we lose timestamp information when logging to stdout, and
# supervsiord's logging capabilities don't have a great way to add timestamps,
# so instead we'll log directly to a file so we can keep the timestamp
# information (since that's helpful for debugging).
