# TODO: Ideally we would leave errlog-level at the default "warn" level.
# However, as of OpenResty 1.15.8.1, this triggers a lot of the new "_G write
# guard" warnings due to globals from "yaml" (via "lyaml" module) and "lfs"
# (via "pl.path" module). If we could force these modules to preload in the
# init or init_worker phases, then that would eliminate these warnings
# (https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/issues/1521), but that doesn't
# seem doable in the current "resty" CLI tool. But since these globals
# shouldn't have a huge impact for these one-off CLI tasks, we'll silence these
# warnings for now. At some point, maybe the lyaml or lfs modules will improve
# to eliminate globals.
