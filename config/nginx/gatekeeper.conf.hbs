# This is mainly disabled due to Varnish randomly turning non-chunked responses
# into chunked responses: https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/ticket/1506
# Since all chunked responses are gzipped regardless of length, this
# effectively means everything might get gzipped, disabling the effectiveness
# of nginx's "gzip_min_length" setting.
#
# This does mean that no gatekeeper error responses will ever get gzipped (over
# rate limit errors, invalid api key errors, etc), since those never interact
# with the "api_router" proxy. So this might be worth revisiting if Varnish
# fixes that issue.
